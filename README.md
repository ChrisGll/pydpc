# pydpc - Python Density Peak Clustering

*Clustering by fast search and find of density peaks* was designed by Alex Rodriguez and Alessandro Laio; see their [project page](http://people.sissa.it/~laio/Research/Res_clustering.php) for more information.

The pydpc package aims to make this algorithm available for Python users.
